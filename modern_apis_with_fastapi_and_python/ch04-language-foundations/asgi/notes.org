* What's the point?

  - How can you write something and then you can host it with different hosting
    services?
    (Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation)
  - longest time WSGI (Web Server Gate Interface) - Gunicorn / MicroWSGI
    (pronounced like Whisgey)

  - WSGI:
    - linear execution
      get task
      execute task
      respond
    - no concurrent thing

  - ASGI:
    - Asynchronous Server Gate Interface
